# python-shopping-cart
It is a simple shopping cart that I created with the Python scripting language. University students can benefit from this small software that I have shared.

It is a software that I developed 1 year ago. It is open to development and available. It is a python code system that I wrote out of boredom and then decorated with small touches.

What can be done with this software?
1) With a MySQL connection, data can be retrieved with an active HTTP/1.1 system.
2) A fast and seamless shopping integration system can be established by connecting to a website.
3) Changes can be made to inspire your university assignments.

I hope it has been a useful study for you!

Stay healthy, bye bye!
